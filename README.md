# hello-world
just another repository

Hi Everyone,

My name is clinton ko. I am very curious about the github platform. 
I really want to host a blog, where i could upload pictures and share my stories to other
However, I do not know how to accomplish it in a easy using and maintaining way.
Currently, I am looking for learning github pages, which could create a static website.
